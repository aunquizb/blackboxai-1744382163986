# Quiz App

## Project Overview

Quiz App is a web-based application that allows users to register, log in, and take quizzes. It includes a user-friendly interface crafted with Tailwind CSS and features for both students and administrators. Students can register to take quizzes and track their results, while administrators can create and manage quizzes.

## Installation

To set up the Quiz App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quiz-app
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:**
   Simply double-click `index.html` or open it through your browser.

Alternatively, you can use a local server to serve the files. A package like `Live Server` can be used in your favorite code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Register a new account by clicking on the "Register" button.
3. Log in using your credentials.
4. If you are an admin, you will have the ability to create new quizzes and add questions. If you are a student, you can view available quizzes and take them.
5. After completing a quiz, your results will be available for review.

## Features

- **User Registration:** New users can create accounts (as either Student or Admin).
- **User Authentication:** Secure login for returning users.
- **Quiz Creation:** Admins can create quizzes, adding multiple questions for each quiz.
- **Quiz Taking:** Students can take quizzes, with a timer feature to enhance time management.
- **Results Tracking:** Students can view their quiz results, which include scores and performance metrics.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application, included via CDN.
- **Font Awesome:** For icons, included via CDN.

No additional dependencies are required to run the application as it primarily relies on HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
